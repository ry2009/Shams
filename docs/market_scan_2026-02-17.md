## Strategic inference for SHAMS (inference from sources)

1. **Control the execution loop, not just chat**
   - Most tools market assistance or planning; SHAMS should keep autonomous action loops (assign -> review -> export) as first-class product behavior.

2. **Win the “McLeod coexistence” phase**
   - Incumbent gravity is real; bridge + auditability + replay is the fastest path to production use before full replacement.

3. **Differentiate by deterministic financial controls**
   - Ticket/rate/zone/miles checks tied to billing outcomes are harder to commoditize than generic LLM assistants.

4. **Target bulky manual workflows with measurable KPIs**
   - Ticket QA latency, billing readiness rate, leakage recovery, and click/step reduction are defensible ROI metrics for SMB/mid-market fleets.

## SHAMS moat to keep building

- Autonomous cycle endpoint for real actions, not suggestions only
- Deterministic rules + confidence gates + event timeline audit
- Clean role-based UX replacing dispatcher/billing click-heavy legacy flows
- Hard integration contracts (no fake syncs/fallback behavior in production paths)
